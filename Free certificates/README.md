# Free Certificates

## Original Creator: [Rameez Akhtar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramease) 

In these evil days of pandemic nothing is same as before. Things turned out south some went better, but nothing is same.

I started to drink from the ocean of knowledge during the epoch of **locked down** days and soon it engulfed my monthly savings, leaving me to stray around the world wide web.

#### This is when I started to gather free courses(with certificates)

I am trying to gather and accumulate the certificates here, on one place.
